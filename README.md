Pixel Play'25 Challenge
Overview
This project focuses on classifying animal images into 50 distinct classes using ResNet101, a deep convolutional neural network renowned for its robust feature extraction capabilities. The goal was to achieve high accuracy while minimizing computational costs by using pretrained weights and employing advanced training strategies such as freezing and unfreezing of some layers.

The design of this project was done with care so that it runs optimally and is computationally efficient. Here is a detailed breakdown of the most important aspects of the code and their functions:
1. Importing necessary modules
2. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
* Custom Dataset Creation: Images were loaded into a custom dataset that returned data in NumPy format. This dataset allowed for random access during every epoch and was loaded in batches of size 16.
* Data Splitting: 15% of the data was kept for evaluation and the rest was used for training. Test data has been processed independently with randomised transformations.
* Image Transformations:
  - Random cropping at between 70%-100% then resized to 300x300.
  - Random horizontal flipping plus rotation at between Â±30 degrees for enhanced generalization.
  - Pixel values normalized with mean [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and standard deviation [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].
3. Model Development:
* Architecture:
  - Choosen ResNet 101 was the reason of its advanced residual connections which mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients in deep networks.
  - Resnet comprised preliminary convolutional and max pooling layers, deep residual layers, and a fully connected layer for final classification.
* Pre-trained Weights: Used ImageNet-pre-trained weights and let the network use the previously gained knowledge for feature extraction.
4. Training Strategy:
* Loss Function: Cross-entropy loss was considered to evaluate the task accuracy.
* Optimizer: SGD used for weight updates
* Learning Rate Scheduler:
  - MultiStepLR scheduler was implemented so that to get the scheduler at runtime
  - factor 0.9 learning rate dropping after epochs 16 and 21 to have the desired convergence in loss graph observations.
* Freezing Layers:
  - All layers except last convolutional block and fully connected head were frozen during initial training.
  - It ensured that the network maintained features learned and only updated higher layers for the given dataset.
5. Explanation and Robustness:
* Random transformations guaranteed that the model learned robust features through the exposition to different orientations and perspectives.
* At testing, it had employed a voting mechanism for increased reliability of prediction through averaging several predictions per image.
6. Output Generation:
* Final predictions were saved in CSV format for evaluation and submission
7. Hardware:
* The training process employed Kaggle's P100 GPU, which delivered enough computational power to train the model computationally efficiently despite kernel crashes.
Important Implementation Basics:
* Freezing and Unfreezing Layers: In this approach, the freezing and unfreezing of layers played a crucial role in balancing computations and performance. It helped accelerate convergence with the goal of avoiding accuracy loss.
* Learning Rate Scheduling: Adaptive learning rate adjustment led to stable and effective training over 25 epochs.
* Data Augmentation: Random cropping, flipping, and rotation highly enhanced the generalization capacity of the model.
* Prediction Voting Mechanism: This reduced the effects of outliers' predictions and enhanced the trustability of final outcomes.

Results:

* Seen Dataset (15% evaluation split): It obtained an accuracy of 91-93%.
* Unseen Dataset (test): It achieved 80% accuracy.

Challenges and Solutions

2. Computational Power:
* It took around 2-3 hours to train on Kaggle's GPU P100.
* Optimized model configurations for runtime.
3. Imbalanced Dataset:
* Data augmentation to correct misclassification (cow and Dalmatians).
4. Accuracy Variability:
* Careful debugging after updates to keep the accuracy and performance optimized.
5. Batch Size Optimization
* Experimental optimizations for fine-tuned accuracy with speed in computation.
